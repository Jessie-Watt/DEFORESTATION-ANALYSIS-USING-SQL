# DEFORESTATION-ANALYSIS-USING-SQL
 
# **INTRODUCTION**
This analysis is focused on the manipulation of sql query and its operators to determine the deforestation of countries of several continents. Three dataset was provided for this analysis, this will be solved using sql aggregate functions, joins and even subquerys.

# **ACTIVITY**
1. To determine the total number of countries involved in deforestation.
2. To determine the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000
3. The retrieval of country names that have a forest area(in Square Kilometers) greater than the average forest area of all countries in the 'high Income' income group
4. To calculate the average total area (in square miles) for countries in the 'upper middle income' income group, then compare the result with the rest of the income categories.
5. To detemine the total forst area( in square kilometers) for countries in the 'high Income' income group, alos compare with the other income categories
6. What are the countries from each region or continent having the highest forest area?

# **SKILL DEMONSTRATED**

1). Creating a new database and the importation of three datasets into the table section of the new
2). The use of operational keywords 
3). Joins and subquerys
